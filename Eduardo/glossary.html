                    The foundation of aerobic fitness. Steady, sustainable pace where you can still hold a conversation but with occasional pauses. This is where most training volume should occur.
                </div>
                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Builds mitochondrial density, fat oxidation capacity, and aerobic engine. Elite cyclists spend 50-70% of their training time here. It's the foundation that allows you to go hard when it counts.

                    Moderately hard, steady effort. Conversation becomes difficult. Also called "sweet spot" (upper Z3, ~88-93% FTP) because it provides substantial stimulus without excessive fatigue.
                </div>
                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Improves lactate clearance and muscular endurance. Sweet spot training is particularly effective for time-limited athletes. However, too much Z3 ("grey zone") can limit recovery and prevent hard efforts.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Directly improves FTP and time-trial performance. Raises your threshold so you can sustain higher power outputs. Critical for climbing and time trials, but requires 48-72h recovery.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Expands your aerobic ceiling and improves maximum oxygen uptake. Essential for closing gaps, climbing short hills, and responding to attacks. Highly fatiguing - quality over quantity matters.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Predicts climbing performance better than absolute power. On steep climbs, you're fighting gravity, so power-to-weight ratio is everything. 4.0+ W/kg is competitive at local races; 5.0+ is Cat 1/2 level.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Measures pacing discipline and efficiency. For endurance rides and time trials, aim for 1.02-1.10. High VI (>1.15) indicates poor pacing or highly variable terrain/efforts, which increases fatigue for the same average power.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Injury and illness risk increases sharply when ACWR exceeds 1.5 (ramping volume too quickly). Staying in the 0.8-1.3 range minimizes injury risk while allowing progressive overload.

                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Rising EF over time indicates improved aerobic efficiency - you're producing more power for the same heart rate (or the same power at lower heart rate). Track EF on steady Z2 rides to monitor base fitness improvements.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> TTE is a key limiter for time trials and climbing. You might have decent FTP but poor TTE, meaning you can't utilize your FTP fully in races. Improved through threshold intervals and tempo-over-distance work.

                    Intensity distribution where ~80% of training time is easy (Z1-Z2) and ~20% is hard (Z4-Z5+), with minimal time in Z3. Creates a "polarized" distribution with two distinct intensity peaks.
                </div>
                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The approach used by most elite endurance athletes. Allows high total volume while maintaining quality in hard sessions. Going easy enough on easy days enables going hard enough on hard days. Reduces injury/burnout risk.

                <div class="term-definition">
                    Intensity distribution with most time in Z2, moderate time in Z3/Z4, and small amount in Z5. Forms a pyramid shape when graphed. Example: 70% Z2, 20% Z3/Z4, 10% Z5.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Common among masters/time-limited athletes. More sustainable than threshold-heavy training. Good for building base fitness and maintaining consistency. Less risky than polarized for recovery-limited athletes.

                <div class="term-definition">
                    Heavy focus on Z3-Z4 work (tempo and threshold). Typically 40-50% of training time at moderate-high intensity.
                </div>
                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Can rapidly improve FTP in short training blocks (4-8 weeks). However, high injury/burnout risk with prolonged use. Best for short-term FTP gains before events, not year-round. Requires excellent recovery practices.

                    Systematic planning of training into phases (macrocycle, mesocycle, microcycle) with specific goals. Typically: Base ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Peak ‚Üí Recovery ‚Üí Race.
                </div>
                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> You can't be in peak form year-round. Periodization prevents plateaus, reduces injury risk, and ensures you're fresh for key events. Each phase has specific volume/intensity targets that build upon previous phases.

                <div class="term-name">Deload Week</div>
                <div class="term-definition">
                    Planned recovery week with 40-60% reduction in training volume/intensity. Typically every 3-4 weeks. Maintains frequency but reduces duration and intensity.
                </div>
                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Adaptations occur during recovery, not during training. Deload weeks allow your body to absorb the previous weeks' training stress, convert it to fitness, and prepare for the next training block. Skipping deloads leads to cumulative fatigue.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your body adapts to current training loads. To improve, you must gradually increase stress. Too fast = injury/overtraining. Too slow = plateau. The 5-10% rule balances adaptation stimulus with recovery capacity.

                    Maximum rate at which your body can consume oxygen during maximal exercise. Measured in ml/kg/min. Elite cyclists: 70-85 ml/kg/min. Recreational: 40-55 ml/kg/min.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Sets your aerobic ceiling - the upper limit of your endurance capacity. While partly genetic, it's trainable through high-intensity intervals (Z5+). Higher VO2 max enables higher sustainable power outputs.

                <div class="term-definition">
                    The exercise intensity where lactate begins accumulating faster than it can be cleared. Closely related to FTP. The primary limiter for sustained efforts.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> You can ride just below threshold for hours, but minutes above it. Raising your threshold (via Z3-Z4 training) allows higher sustainable speeds. It's the single most trainable aspect of endurance performance.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Consistency beats intensity. Missing sessions creates fitness gaps. Erratic volume (big weeks followed by nothing) prevents adaptation. Aim for 4-6 rides/week year-round rather than sporadic blocks of high volume.

                <div class="term-definition">
                    Pedal revolutions per minute (rpm). Optimal cadence varies by rider but typically 85-95 rpm for endurance, 95-105 rpm for climbing, 75-85 rpm for time trials.

                <div class="term-why">
                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Cadence affects muscular vs. cardiovascular stress. Very low cadence (<70 rpm) increases muscular fatigue and injury risk. Very high cadence (>110 rpm) is cardiovascularly demanding. Find your optimal cadence where power feels sustainable.
